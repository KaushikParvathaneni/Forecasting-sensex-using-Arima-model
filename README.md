# Forecasting-sensex-using-Arima-model

This project explores the use of the ARIMA model for forecasting economic data, using SENSEX data as the example dataset to demonstrate its application. The term Sensex (Stock Exchange Sensitive Index) refers to the benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India. Comprised of 30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE, the Sensex provides a gauge of India's economy. It is float-adjusted and market capitalization-weighted, representing a diverse range of industries within the Indian market. The companies that make up the Sensex are selected from the Bombay Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in India and one of the largest in the world. Investors globally use the Sensex as a barometer of the overall state of the Indian economy, which has experienced substantial growth in recent decades.
